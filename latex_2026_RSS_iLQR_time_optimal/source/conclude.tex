This paper develops a new approach \abbrAl for horizon-optimal OC problems with linear and nonlinear dynamics.
The key insight is to rewrite the Riccati recursion into a LFT form which allows computational reuse.
For time-varying HO-LQR problems, \abbrAlg reduces the runtime complexity from quadratic to linear with respect to the maximum possible horizon $N$.
For nonlinear system, the proposed \abbrAlgg runs fast while finding high-quality solutions.
We plan to include more sophisticated constraints such as collision avoidance into our \abbrAl in our future work.
